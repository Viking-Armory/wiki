After getting everything installed the way you want it make sure you back it up. I like to make a complete ‘dd’ copy of my SD card. Do a df to find out what your SD card is mounted as and then umount it. Then:

<code ->
sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb of=raspbian.img
</code>

I then zip up the new image. I got a 30+ GB image to a 1.2GB zip file.

To restore:

<code ->
sudo dd bs=4M if=raspbian.img of=/dev/sdb
</code>
