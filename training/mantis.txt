====== Mantis ======

Important thing to remember is these targets are at scale, which means you will not need a mansion to be able to practice in your home. The 8″ x 11″ targets are 1/3 scale so if you want to simulate a target at 10 yards (30 feet), I only need to stand roughly 10 feet from this target. The 5″ x 7″ targets are 1/5 scale so if you want to simulate a target at 10 yards (30 feet), I only need to stand roughly 6 feet from this target. The 5″ x 7″ one fit nicely inside of the travel case.
