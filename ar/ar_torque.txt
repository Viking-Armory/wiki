**__My Torque Values:__**

**__AR Compensator (Flash hider)__** No Torque, timing value with the procedure in the Army TM. Hand tight and then tighten a minimum of 90 degrees but no more than 450 degrees to timing. Don't over tighten, don't loosen.

**__AR Barrel Nut__** 30 Ft. lbs. Minimum, not to exceed 80 Ft. Lbs. to align the next slot in the barrel nut. The 80 Ft. Lbs is not stated in the TM, but I don't know how you would line up the gas tube, in certain situations without going over 30 Ft. Lbs. Unless you use shims. I don't think most folks will have any laying around. This torque spec is common across the community and internet.

**__AR Carrier Key Screws__** 50-58 INCH pounds torque

**__AR Lower Receiver Extension (Buffer Tube/Castle Nut)__** 40 Ft. lbs for both Rifle and Carbine.

**__M-LOK Accessories:__**

  * For attaching metal accessories to metal hand guards: 35 in/lbs
  * For attaching polymer or metal accessories to polymer hand guards: 15 in/lbs
  * For attaching polymer accessories to metal hand guards: 15 in/lbs

The installation torque values are not minimums, they are recommended limits. The nylon patch compound may slightly affect the torque reading if using an in/lb torque wrench.

Using a small hex wrench should prevent over-tightening. Remember that the recoil lugs are doing most of the work, and excessive torque on the nuts is not required

**__My Comments:__**

The rest of the items in the research below I could not find in the Army TM, manufacture website or in common reference. Until I can find it, I am going with ‘tight’ and the appropriate thread lockers. ‘Tight’ might be the values listed.

I am not saying that the info below is wrong or bad. I could not readily verify it. The above is what I will use, at the end of the day I am responsible for my decisions and you are responsible for yours.
